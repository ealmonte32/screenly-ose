## Screenly-OSE Developer Documentation
_(this document is in its initial phase)_

Here is a high-level overview of the different components that make up the Screenly-OSE system.
![Screenly-OSE Diagram Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/screenly/screenly-ose/master/docs/images/screenly-ose-diagram-overview.png)

* Screenly-Viewer is what drives the screen (Ex: shows web page or image or video)
* Screenly-Server is what the user interacts with (Ex: Web GUI)
* Screenly-Celery is for task/queue/asynchronously executing work outside the HTTP request-response cycle (Ex: periodic cleanup task, upgrade via web)
* Screenly-WebSocket is used for forwarding requests from NGINX to backend Screenly-Server (Ex: )
* Redis is used as a database, cache and message broker. (Ex: )
* SQLite is used as the database for storing the assets information.

These components and their dependencies are mostly installed and handled with Ansible and respective playbooks.

There are currently three versions of Screenly-OSE..
